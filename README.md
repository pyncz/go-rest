# Development

## Let's GO

### ğŸ“¦ Install dependencies
```sh
make i
```

### ğŸ”§ Launch dev server
```sh
make dev
```

> **Warning**
> Don't forget to set environment variables via `.env` file in the root dir. See `.env.template` to know what vars are expected.


## Docker Commands

### ğŸ”„ Restart containers
This command pulls web service's image, recreate and start containers. You will probably use it on server when refresh is required after an update.

```sh
make restart
```

### ğŸš€ Up containers
These commands will build containers by their images and create / start them.

```sh
make build
make up
```
